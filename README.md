# windows-game-launcher
An application written in python, to help open and organize games and apps in windows. Works for steam, origins, Epic Games, and every locally installed game.

To add a new game to the app, just navigate to the application file of the desired game you want to add, and look for a photo for it.


*ANY IMAGE YOU ADD WILL BE SAVED IN THIS APP, YOU CAN SAFELY DELETE IT FROM THE FOLDER YOU LOOKED IT UP.*

And there is currently a bug with the names of the images, so try and put unique names on each.
